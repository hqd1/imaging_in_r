## Overall Pipeline

## Imaging Data Used: Multiple Sclerosis

- Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (brain, spinal chord, optic nerves)
- MS lesions in the brain are areas of active inflammation, demylenation, or permanent tissue damage. 
    - lesions are primarily in the white matter
- The full data is available at https://smart-stats-tools.org. 

## Imaging Data Used: Multiple Sclerosis
  
- MRI is well-suited for assessing lesion burden (volume and patterns) because lesions appear as hyperintensities on FLAIR and T2-w images and as hypointensities on T1-w images.
- Using 5 training and 3 test subjects data from the an open MS data set (http://lit.fe.uni-lj.si/tools.php?lang=eng) [@lesjak2017novel]

```{r readin, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ms.lesion)
library(neurobase)
files = get_image_filenames_list_by_subject(type = "coregistered")
files = files$training02
img_fnames = files[c("T1", "T2", "FLAIR")]
mask_fname = files["mask"]
brain_mask = readnii(files["Brain_Mask"])
imgs = check_nifti(img_fnames)
mask = readnii(mask_fname)
zimgs = lapply(imgs, zscore_img, mask = brain_mask)
inds = getEmptyImageDimensions(brain_mask)
zimgs = lapply(zimgs, applyEmptyImageDimensions, inds = inds)
mask = applyEmptyImageDimensions(mask, inds = inds)
zimgs = c(zimgs, Lesion_Mask = list(mask * 10))
xyz = xyz(mask)
multi_overlay(zimgs, z = xyz[3], text = names(zimgs), 
              text.x = 0.5, text.y = 2.25, text.cex = 2)
```


## Formats of Images

There are multiple imaging formats.  We will use NIfTI:

* Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1)
    - essentially a header and data (binary format)
    - will have extension .nii (uncompressed) or .nii.gz (compressed)
    - we will use 3-D images (4-D and 5-D are possible)
* ANALYZE 7.5 was a precursor to NIfTI 
    - had a `hdr` file (header) and `img` file (data)


## Course Website/Materials

The Course overview is located at (with slides):

**RStudio Server**

For this course, we will use an RStudio Server because installing all the packages can be a lengthy process.  Mostly all the code we show requires a Linux/Mac OSX platform for FSL and other systems:

# Introduction to R

## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- R was implemented over the S language, which was developed by Bell laboratories

- R is both open source and open development

(source: http://www.r-project.org/)


## Why R?

* Powerful and flexible

* Free (open source)

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Designed for statistical computing

* High level language

**Why not R?**

* Fairly steep learning curve

* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Java, Perl, Python)

## What comes with R

* R revolves around functions
    * Commands that take input, performs computations, and returns results
    * When you download R, it has a "base" set of functions/packages (**base R**)
* Functions are enclosed in packages
    - A package is collection of functions, documentation, data, and tutorials (called vignettes).
    * Written by R users/developers (like us) - **some are bad**
    - You install a package using the `install.packages` command/function:

```r
install.packages("oro.nifti")
```

`install.packages` is a function, `"oro.nifti"` is a character string.

## Neuroconductor 

* Most packages are in a repository [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Neuroconductor (https://neuroconductor.org/) has packages related to medical imaging

```r
source("https://neuroconductor.org/neurocLite.R")
neuro_install("oro.nifti")
```


## Loading Packages

When you install a package, it's downloaded to the hard disk.  That *doesn't* mean that you can use the functions from that package just yet.

- You "load"/import a package into memory using the `library` command

For example, to load the `oro.nifti` package:

```r
library(oro.nifti)
```

Now, functions from the `oro.nifti` package can be used.

## RStudio (the software)

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R (made by RStudio the company)

* It helps the user effectively and more easily use R.
    * Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation
    * Easily manage multiple working directories and projects
* Is NOT dropdown statistical tools (such as Stata)
    * See [Rcmdr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html) or [Radiant](http://vnijs.github.io/radiant/) 



# R essentially is a command line with a set of functions loaded


## RStudio/R Console

* Where code is executed (where things happen)
* You can type here for things interactively
* Code is **not saved** on your disk
    * Can act as a calculator
    * Creating variables/objects
    * Applying functions


## RStudio/R Console <img src="standard_console.png" style="width: 95%; display: block; margin: auto;"> 
<!-- ![Console]() -->

## Source

* Where files open to
* Have R code and comments in them
    * Static copy of what you did (reproducability)
    * Try things out interactively, then add to your script
* Can highlight and press (CMD+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)) to run the code
* Code is saved to disk


## Source/Editor <img src="standard_script.png" style="width: 95%; display: block; margin: auto;"> 
<!-- ![Script](r-rstudio-1-3-script.png) -->

## Workspace/Environment

* Tells you what **objects** are in R
* What exists in memory/what is loaded?/what did I read in?

**History**

* Shows previous commands.  Good to look at for debugging, but **don't rely** on it as a script.  Make a script!
* Also type the "up" key in the Console to scroll through previous commands

## Workspace/Environment <img src="standard_workspace.png" style="width: 95%; display: block; margin: auto;"> 
<!-- ![Workspace]() -->


## Other Panes

* **Files** - shows the files on your computer of the directory you are working in
* **Viewer** - can view data or R objects
* **Help** - shows help of R commands
* **Plots** - pretty pictures
* **Packages** - list of R packages that are loaded in memory
